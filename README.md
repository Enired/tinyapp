## Personal Notes:
This project was quite the learning experience. The project may undergo a few more changes for personal practice, but I will test that on a different branchðŸŒ¿ along with stretch goals outlined on the assignment page. I would also like to see it become much cleaner in terms of its appearance but that will come as I learn more about htmlðŸ”¥. Thank you to the mentors who helped me fix my bugs and did a code review for me to make the logic more streamlined.
